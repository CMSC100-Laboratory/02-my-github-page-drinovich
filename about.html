                <p id="ap1">&nbsp; &nbsp; Hi! I am Aldrin Marcus T. Loudlow, some kid who’s unsure of what to do so he dabbled in a bit of Computer Science. I’ve grown a bit of a love-hate relationship with programming, but I am learning to let that love prevail :DD I have experience programming HTML and CSS from joining clubs during elementary, in 10th grade Computer class, and briefly during my first semester of first year along with JavaScript, then Python, C, and a little bit of Java. I'd say I'm most confident in programming in C language! Between frontend and backend, I definitely find frontend developing more appealing, as I also like art and design <span id="hort">❤︎</span></p>
